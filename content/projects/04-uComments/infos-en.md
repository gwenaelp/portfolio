## uComments - Comment system for static websites
`Webapp` `Firebase` `React` `Vue.js` `Webpack`


A short project, (5 days of development) aiming to establish an alternative to disqus, using realtime technologies.

Everything was developped with only Firebase as backend. The application is served with a static file server and every data is send through websockets, allowing instant refresh (in the admin and in the comment module) when a comment is posted or modified.
