`Hybrid webapp` `Dashy` `Ember.js` `Cordova`


A small hybrid webapp made with the Dashy framework (see related project) that serves as a proof of concept.

This mobile application allows to download a light version of webpages directly in your browser and to view them once you are offline.
It is also possible to download pages linked in a RSS feed, thus downloading a complete feed and its article in one time.
