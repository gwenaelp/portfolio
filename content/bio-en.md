# Hi, I'm Gwen!

I’m a web software engineer. I use to experiment a lot with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I'm always dabbling with Javascript, whether it is front-end or Back-end.
I build simple web apps that works. I do it well.

I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.
