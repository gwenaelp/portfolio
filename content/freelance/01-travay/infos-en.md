## &ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast; Travay - A job board for Haiti, where people are paid with cryptocurrency

A project I worked on as a freelancer. I helped the existing team in developing features and help on architecture.

My job consisted in extracting a set of components and create an external library containing them. I also worked in the initial creation of the project, on webpack configuration, and other tooling issues.

Other tasks I was involved in are internationalization, form validation, components creation...
