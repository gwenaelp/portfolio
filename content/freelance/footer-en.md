## Mentoring and teaching

I am an OpenClassRooms (OC) mentor. OC is a french website quite similar to Udemy. I train people and I ensure that they have all the materials to learn. I meet them regularly to help them accomplish projects they have to hand in to get their certifications. Some of the issued certifications lead to an actual diploma, which is recognized by France.

I also do some teaching on my spare time. I regularly help students and professionals to develop skills and learn more about fullstack web development.

## Blogging

I like to talk about tech and web development. I got enrolled by Sourcerer to write blog posts on their official blog. I am currently working with LogRocket on a similar mission.
